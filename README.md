# # STORAGE :-

## 1. PRIMARY STORAGE - 
Primary storage (also called main memory or primary memory) is the computer’s immediate working memory — the place where data and instructions are kept while the CPU is using them.

It is fast, directly accessible by the CPU, but usually volatile (contents are lost when power is turned off).

#### Key Characteristics
* High speed – Much faster than secondary storage (like hard drives).

* Volatile – Most types lose data when the computer is shut down.

* Smaller capacity – Usually measured in GBs (secondary storage is in TBs).

* Direct CPU access – CPU can read/write without intermediate steps.

#### Types of Primary Storage
* RAM (Random Access Memory) – Temporary storage for currently running programs and data.

* ROM (Read-Only Memory) – Permanent storage for essential startup instructions (firmware).

* Cache Memory – Ultra-fast memory inside or very close to the CPU for frequently used data.

* Registers – Very small, very fast storage locations inside the CPU.

## 2. SECONDARY STORAGE -

Secondary storage (also called external storage or auxiliary storage) is the type of computer memory used to store data permanently — even when the computer is turned off.
It is slower than primary storage but has much larger capacity and is non-volatile.

#### Key Characteristics
* Non-volatile – Keeps data without power.

* Large capacity – Can store terabytes or even petabytes of data.

* Slower than primary storage – Requires input/output operations.

* Cheaper per GB compared to RAM.

# # NETWORK :-  

### 1. ISP - It ISP stands for Internet Service Provider.

It’s a company or organization that provides access to the internet for individuals, businesses, and other organizations.

#### Main Functions of an ISP
* Connects you to the internet using different technologies (fiber, DSL, cable, satellite, wireless).

* Assigns you an IP address so your device can communicate online.

* May provide extra services like email accounts, web hosting, and security tools.

#### Examples of ISPs

* Satellite ISPs – Provide internet to remote areas using satellites.

### 2. IP - Internet Protocol
IP is a set of rules for sending and receiving data across the internet.
It’s part of the TCP/IP model — the foundation of all internet communication.
Data is sent in packets, and IP ensures those packets have the correct address so they reach the right destination.

#### Types of IP
1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

    * Uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

    * About 4.3 billion unique addresses available.

2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

    * Uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

    * Almost unlimited addresses — designed to replace IPv4.

#### Functions of IP
* Addressing: Assigns unique identifiers to devices.

* Routing: Directs data packets to their destination.

* Packet fragmentation/reassembly: Breaks large data into smaller chunks and reassembles them.

### 3. STANDARDS -

Standards are agreed-upon technical rules so that devices from different makers can work together.

#### Set by organizations like:

* IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) → Develops IP, TCP, HTTP, etc.

* IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) → Wi-Fi (802.11), Ethernet (802.3).

* ISO (International Organization for Standardization) → OSI model, file formats.

* W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) → HTML, CSS web standards.

#### Examples of Networking Standards

* IEEE 802.11 → Wi-Fi

* HTTP/HTTPS → Web data transfer

* SMTP → Email sending

* FTP → File transfer

* DNS → Domain name resolution

### 4. APIPA - It stands for Automatic Private IP Addressing.

It’s a feature in Windows (and some other OSes) that automatically assigns an IP address to a device when it can’t get one from a DHCP server.

#### Key Points
* APIPA = local communication only (no internet).

* Triggered when DHCP fails.

* Useful for small peer-to-peer setups without a DHCP server.

## COMPUTER NETWORKS 

### 1. LAN - It stands for Local Area Network.

It’s a network that connects computers and other devices within a small geographic area, such as a home, school, office, or building.

#### Key Features of LAN

* High speed: Usually 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or more.

* Ownership: Typically owned, controlled, and maintained by a single person or organization.

* Connection media: Can be wired (Ethernet cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi).

#### Examples
* Computers connected in an office to share files and printers.

* School computer lab.

### 2. MAN - It stands for Metropolitan Area Network.

It’s a type of computer network that covers a city, large campus, or a group of nearby buildings — bigger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

#### Key Features of MAN
* Coverage area: From a few kilometers to about 50 km.

* Speed: Often in the range of 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps (can be higher with fiber).

* Ownership: May be owned by a single organization, a group of organizations, or a service provider.

* Technology: Often uses fiber optic cables, microwave links, or leased lines.

#### Examples
* A network connecting all branches of a city’s public library.

* University campuses spread across a city.

### 3. WAN - It  stands for Wide Area Network.

It’s a network that covers a large geographical area, such as a country, continent, or even the whole world — connecting multiple LANs and MANs together. The internet itself is the largest WAN.

#### Key Features of WAN
* Coverage area: From hundreds of kilometers to worldwide.

* Speed: Varies — typically slower than LAN/MAN (due to distance), but modern WANs with fiber and satellite can still be very fast.

* Ownership: Often owned and managed by multiple organizations or telecom companies.

* Technology: Uses fiber optics, undersea cables, satellites, microwave links, and public telecommunication networks.

#### Examples
* The Internet.

* Decentralized: No single owner — it’s managed collectively by ISPs, governments, and organizations.

* Protocols: Uses TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and others for communication.

* Resources: Websites, email, cloud services, streaming platforms, online apps.

### 2. INTRANET - 
An Intranet is a private network that uses Internet technologies (like web browsers and TCP/IP protocols) but is accessible only to authorized users within an organization. It’s designed for internal communication, collaboration, and resource sharing.

#### Key Features
* Restricted Access: Only employees or members of the organization can log in.

* Ownership: Controlled and maintained by the organization itself.

* Uses Internet Tech: Works like the Internet but behind security walls (firewalls, authentication).

* Purpose: Enhance efficiency, communication, and data security inside the organization.

# NIC
NIC stands for Network Interface Card (also called Network Interface Controller or Network Adapter).
It’s a hardware component — either a physical card or a built-in chip — that allows a computer or other device to connect to a network (like LAN, MAN, WAN, or the Internet).

#### Key Functions
* Physical Connection: Connects the device to the network via cable (Ethernet) or wirelessly (Wi-Fi).

* Data Conversion: Converts data into electrical signals (wired) or radio signals (wireless) and vice versa.

* Unique Identification: Each NIC has a MAC address that uniquely identifies it on a network.

* Communication Management: Handles sending and receiving of data packets.

#### Types
1. Ethernet NIC – Uses cables (RJ-45 connectors).

2. Wireless NIC – Uses Wi-Fi to connect.

3. Fiber Optic NIC – For high-speed optical fiber networks.

## SMART NIC - 
A Smart NIC (Smart Network Interface Card) is an advanced version of a traditional NIC that not only connects a device to a network but also offloads certain networking and security tasks from the CPU to its own built-in processors.

It’s like a network card with a brain — it can process data, run security checks, and handle virtualization right on the card, without bothering the main system CPU.

#### Common Uses
* Cloud Data Centers (Amazon, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).

* High-Frequency Trading Systems (where every microsecond matters).

* AI & Machine Learning clusters (to handle huge data flows).

* Telecom & 5G networks (for efficient data routing).

### Some technologies used with Smart-NIC are:

#### DPDK - It stands for Data Plane Development Kit.

It’s an open-source set of libraries and drivers designed to make packet processing extremely fast — much faster than using the standard Linux kernel networking stack.

##### Together:
DPDK ensures packets move into and out of the Smart NIC at maximum speed without kernel slowdowns.
Smart NIC handles heavy-lifting tasks (firewall, encryption, VXLAN tunneling, routing) before passing data to the CPU.

#### SR-IOV - IT stands for Single Root I/O Virtualization.
It’s a technology that allows a single physical PCIe device (like a NIC, GPU, or storage adapter) to appear as multiple separate virtual devices to the system.

##### Together:
SR-IOV splits a single NIC into multiple Virtual Functions (VFs) so VMs/containers can directly access NIC hardware without going through the hypervisor, reducing latency and CPU usage.

# OSI LAYERS

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model – A 7-layer framework that standardizes how computers communicate over a network.

1. Physical – Sends raw bits over cables/wireless.

2. Data Link – Handles MAC addresses, frames, and error detection.

3. Network – Routes data using IP addresses.

4. Transport – Ensures correct delivery (TCP/UDP).

5. Session – Opens, manages, and closes sessions.

6. Presentation – Translates, encrypts, and compresses data.

7. Application – Interfaces directly with user applications (web, email, etc.).

# USER/KERNEL SPACE

### USER SPACE - 
The part of a computer’s memory where non-privileged code (regular applications) runs.

* Runs applications like browsers, word processors, games, etc.

* Has limited permissions — can’t directly access hardware or critical OS resources.

* Must request hardware or OS services via system calls to the kernel.

* Each process in user space runs in its own isolated memory, so one crashing usually doesn’t crash others or the OS.

#### EXAMPLES:
* Running Chrome
* Python script
* Zoom call

### KERNEL SPACE -
Kernel Space is the part of memory where the operating system core runs with full hardware access, managing processes, memory, and devices. It’s highly privileged — if it crashes, the whole system can fail.

* Has full access to hardware and system resources.

* Handles process management, memory management, device control, and system security.

* Executes privileged instructions that user space programs cannot.

* A crash here can bring down the entire system.

#### EXAMPLES:
* Device drivers (e.g., graphics driver, network driver)
* System call handlers (bridge between apps and hardware)
* Process scheduler (decides which process runs next)
* Memory manager (allocates RAM, handles virtual memory)
* File system management (ext4, NTFS, FAT32, etc.)
